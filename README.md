# One-dimensional quantum scattering from multiple Dirac-delta potentials
This project introduces a Python program designed to simulate a one-dimensional quantum system featuring an array of multiple Dirac delta potentials. The primary objective of this code is to explore quantum scattering phenomena within such a setup. 
## Simulation 

Simmulation covers 4 main aspects: 

1. **Regional Wavefunction Simulation**: We visualize the behavior of the incident particle's wave function as it undergoes scattering from an array of potentials.

2. **Reflection and Transmission probability**: We are able to achieve both analytical and numerical solutions of reflection and transmission probabilities, as well as graphical representations of these probabilities.

3. **Transmission Resonance and Perfect transmission**: We are capable of investigating transmission resonance and determining the analytical eigenenergy associated with perfect transmission.

4. **Scattering in the Presence of impurities**: We investigate scattering phenomena through a system containing impurities. We obtain both analytical and numerical solutions for transmission and reflection probabilities, and visualize the behavior of incident particle scattering from such a system.
